A basic login form, which navigates through homepage, then login page, and then displays the data entered in the next page. This uses `get` and `post` request in express js framework. Apart from that it also involves usage of ejs for display of user input in the last page.

## Comments

This was one of the first projects I did in the field of website development so the interface may not look that beautiful, but it functions well that I can say for sure. You have complete freedom over how to modify the code or styles according to your preference.
