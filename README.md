# Login-form
A basic login form, which navigates through homepage, then login page, and then displays the data entered in the next page. This uses get and post request in express js framework. Apart from that it also involves usage of ejs for display of user input in thelast page.

## How to use
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed in your system. In case you do not have it you can download from [here](https://nodejs.org/en).

2. Navigate to the directory you want to create project in. Then create a package using the below command:
   ```
   npm init -y
   ```
3. Now you need to install express.js and ejs installed on your system.
   ```
   npm install express ejs
   ```
4. Make a js file names server.js. 

> server.js is provided

5. Make two html files, one will be our homepage and other will be the login page.

> both home.html and login.html are provided

6. Now make an ejs file which will be our result or response page to show the entered credentials.

> response.ejs is provided

7. At last create a folder names 'public' and create the css file for your project. 

> styles.css and a background image is provided in public folder. Although I did not spend much time writing this, you have complete freedom over the styles to modify it according to your preferences.
